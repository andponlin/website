The standards that govern the Haiku community are similar to the *Unwritten Constitutions* that govern some countries, where their constitution simply acts as an aggregation of other laws, rather than a standalone constitution.

## Glossary

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Community Member|The term "community member" is used in this document to refer to any individual who is engaged with the Haiku project in any way.|
|Communications Channel|The term "communications channel" is intended to cover all communications channels related to the Haiku project.  Examples of "communications channels" include IRC, mailing lists, emails, code-reviews, discussion boards and other media.|
|Development Team|The term "development team" is used to refer to a group of individuals who have commit access into the Haiku source code repository and who are recently actively engaged on the project contributing to the source code.|

## Volunteers

The Haiku project is contributed to by a number of people who volunteer their time.  These volunteer contributors often have busy lives and have to consider other activities and obligations in their lives ahead of following their interests in the Haiku project.  Often volunteer contributors have periods in their lives when it is feasible to engage with the Haiku project and times when it is not feasible.  Some volunteer contributors may contribute for a time and then stop contributing as their life priorities and interests change.

Whilst a volunteer contributor may try to help and may be sympathetic to any given community member's questions or requests, a volunteer contributor has no actual obligation to the community or any community member to;

- continue to provide volunteer contributions
- provide contributions at any fixed frequency
- to meet any assumed deadline
- support their contributions in the future
- to perform work on any specific element of the project

## Communication

### Direct 'vs Public Communications

Owing to the open-source nature of the Haiku project, there are a number of public communications channels that are provided and are administered.  Certain contributors and particularly members of the development team do not want to be singled out as representing the project as a whole.  These individuals also do not want to take on an obligatory communicator role.  For this reason, please use public rather than private channels for communication.  Some situations where private communications may be appropriate;

* where security or privacy concerns need to be raised and where the information should not be public
* where another community member's behavior is inappropriate or offensive and you need to address the issue
* where contributors are collaborating about specific details and both parties are happy to communicate in this way

### Inappropriate Content and Behaviour

Discussions relating to subjects that are clearly off-topic such as religion, politics, gender and ethnicity should not be undertaken across any of the communications channels.  Community members should also refrain from making sexually suggestive comments or using sexual inuendo toward other community members using any of the communications channels.

Insults or personal attacks on communication channels should be avoided.  The tone of conversation should be kept polite and factual; be nice and keep the project fun for the whole community.

### Advertising

The communications channels should not be used for advertising products, services or projects that are not directly related to the Haiku project.

### Mailing List Etiquette

Specific rules relating to use of Haiku-related mailing lists can be found [here]("/community/ml/etiquette").  The rules are in place to ensure the readability of messages by a wide audience and to improve the ability to archive the messages.

Mailing list messages cannot be deleted or edited once they have been sent and topics cannot be locked.  For this reason community members should think twice before sending a message to a mailing list.

### Bug Tracker Etiquette

There are a few [social rules](https://dev.haiku-os.org/wiki/BugTrackerEtiquette) related to use of the Haiku [bug tracker](https://dev.haiku-os.org) system that all community members are required to observe.

### Remedies 

In the case that a community member exhibits inappropriate behavior, the impacted party should raise the issue to a member or members of the Haiku development team.  As an exception to the usual rules, the impacted party is allowed to contact individual members of the development team privately in this case.  If it is unclear how to do this or it provides difficult to communicate with a member of the Haiku development team, instead get in touch with `contact@haiku-inc.org`.  If the inappropriate content is on the forums, the impacted party is also able to flag the offending items as inappropriate directly.  These items will be reviewed by the moderation team.
  
The Haiku development team reserve the right to moderate or remove posts of an inappropriate nature, ban users from the forums, ban users from the mailing lists, remove commit access for developers, or take any other action that seems appropriate and fitting on a case by case basis.

## Trademarks and Copyrights

### Trademark Policy

[Haiku, Inc](https://haiku-inc.org). owns the 'Haiku'® name, HAIKU logo®, HAIKU Background Leaf™, and HAIKU Leaf™ (registered) trademarks. As an open source project, the name and brand that is associated with the Project is vital to the Project's reputation and the sense of familiarity that end-users expect from the Software. Anyone is able to freely use the code that comprises Haiku, however the trademarks of Haiku cannot freely be used in the same liberal manner.

The [Trademark Policy](/about/trademark_policy) page on the "about" section of this website contains the latest policy revision.

### Haiku Distribution Guidelines

The Haiku project believes that having one distribution (the one officially released by the project) is the best long term strategy to ensure success of the operating system.  For this reason anyone who is considering creating a new distribution should think long and hard before doing so.

The [Haiku Distro Guidelines](/community/guidelines_creating_haiku_distribution) page on the "about" section of this website contains the latest policy revision regarding the creation of a Haiku distribution.

## Software

### General Strategy for Releases

As the Haiku project is dominated by volunteer effort, the project is not able to commit to fixed deadlines because it is not possible to ascertain the level of contributions available over a period of time and it is also not possible to direct any of the development team to any specific task.  The team is self-organizing and each individual applies themself to the project as they see fit or as they wish.  For this reason each build -- be that ad-hoc, nightly or a formal release -- contains the appropriate contributions from the contributors to that point in time.

### Nightly Images

Haiku's nightly images are a build of the entire operating system that contains the latest enhancements, bug fixes, and hardware support. Please keep in mind that there may also be regressions and broken features in these builds which have not yet been identified or resolved. Users should only use a nightly build at their own risk and be aware of the potential for experiencing issues.

### Formal Releases

The Haiku project aims to make an annual release of the operating system.  In general a formal release will tend to be made in the northern hemisphere spring / southern hemisphere autumn.  The rationale for this timing is because it is the time of year at which the development team are most likely to have capacity to deal with a release.  At the release time, the development team will attempt to stabilize the state of the project and to create a reference point for users of the operating system.  A release may be deferred or may be cancelled entirely if there are difficulties making the release for any reason.

### Coding Guidelines

The information in the Haiku [Coding Guidelines](/development/coding-guidelines) is most important to the project.

Some code in the project does not match the guidelines. The non-compliant code is largely due to such material being authored before the guidelines were published. Assistance with modifying the non-compliant material to reach compliance is welcome as long as the related commit documents that the changes are related to guideline-compliance and do not contain functional changes.  Take care not to mix functional changes into a commit that is otherwise has the purpose of improving guideline compliance.

If you will be contributing code or patches to Haiku, you will need to strictly follow the coding guidelines. Code which does not follow these guidelines will not be accepted. The guidelines have been in place for a long time affecting the whole code base and there is little appetite for discussing changes to the coding guidelines.

### User Demands

Some community members are occasionally frustrated that a feature or function that they would like is not available on the platform or is not sufficiently developed for their actual or perceived purpose.  In such situations, keep in mind that the contributors to the project are doing so mostly on a volunteer basis and because the work interests them.  Although often times, contributors are interested to hear about any problems that users are having, the contributors are not beholden to users' requirements.

If you are unable to contribute materially to the software yourself, the best way that you can achieve the goal of having a feature implemented is by using the [bug tracker](https://dev.haiku-os.org) system.  Identify if there is an existing ticket that correlates with your requirements or if there is no existing ticket then create one.  You should document factually, clearly and accurately the problem you have.  Make sure there is enough detail that the problem can easily be understood and reproduced by a contributor.  If there are obvious resources that might help such as input / output files, screenshots, logs etc... then attach those to the ticket directly.

Another way that you may be able to get a desired feature implemented is to offer a commission to a contributor to work on the feature.  You are best to discuss this on the developers' [mailing list](https://www.haiku-os.org/community/ml) if you were interested in trying to find somebody to help.

Using an impolite or demanding communications style with an individual or the development team as a whole to try to agressively push for your feature is unlikely to yield a positive result.
